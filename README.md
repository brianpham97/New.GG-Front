# Overview

Developed a functional front-end application for users who are new to the game League of Legends and need help picking a champion to learn or for veteran players who want to look into a new champion to practice.

### Demos

<details><summary>Role and Category Select</summary>
```sh
Champions are sorted by roles they are usually played in and categorized by either 'Meta' or 'Thirst'. Meta champions were picked from [U.GG's](https://u.gg/lol/mid-lane-tier-list?rank=overall) S-S+ tier list (Patch 12.18, 9/27/2022). Thirst champions were picked by me ðŸ˜›.
```
